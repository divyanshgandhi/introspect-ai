From what you know about me, I want you to apply these insights that I learned from a resource to my life. I am a software engineer, strong in Python, working a day job, and operating with a limited budget on side projects. My primary goals are to launch an AI MVP in 90 days and improve my learning retention. My interests include AI app-building, productivity hacks, and personal knowledge management. Given that I have multiple interests and ambitions, please use these insights to create a tailored, actionable plan:

point**: Prioritize your passions and allocate more energy and time to the most important ones to ensure faster progress and avoid spreading yourself too thin.
point**: Implement time blocking by dedicating specific blocks of time in your day to each priority, a proven time management strategy.
point**: Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to break down plans, track progress, reduce stress, and prevent burnout.
point**: Be open to readjusting your plans and taking longer breaks if you experience signs of burnout like feeling overwhelmed, unmotivated, or fatigued.
point**: Look for synergies between your interests to merge passions into multifaceted projects, maximizing your time and creative energy.
point**: Surround yourself with a supportive community that understands and encourages your multifaceted lifestyle for inspiration, accountability, and new perspectives.
point**: Embrace the mindset of being a "multipotentialite," celebrating your diverse strengths and talents rather than feeling constrained by societal pressures to pick one true calling.

Based on my context as a "multipotentialite" aiming for specific technical and learning goals, please provide an actionable plan that includes specific steps, a clear timeline, and measurable metrics. Focus on how I can leverage my strengths in Python and my interest in productivity hacks and personal knowledge management to achieve my AI MVP launch goal and improve learning retention, all while managing my day job and limited budget. How can I best prioritize AI app-building to meet the 90-day deadline, integrate productivity hacks and PKM for learning retention, and find synergies between these interests? What specific actions should I take each week or month within the 90-day window?
