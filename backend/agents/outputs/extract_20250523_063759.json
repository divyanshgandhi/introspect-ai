  "title": "Build a Multimodal Agentic App with Flutter, Vertex AI & Firebase",
  "summary": "This video demonstrates how to build multimodal agentic applications using Flutter, Vertex AI, and Firebase. It introduces AI agents as applications that achieve goals by observing and acting upon the world through tools, powered by large language models like Google's Gemini. The Firebase Vertex AI SDK is highlighted as a production-ready solution for integrating generative AI capabilities, including function calling and multimodal prompting, into Flutter apps. The demo showcases an agentic app manager that processes user feedback, takes actions (like changing app themes or fonts), and generates detailed reports. The video also touches upon image generation with Imagen 3 and real-time bidirectional audio streaming with Gemini Live API, emphasizing Flutter's single codebase advantage for multiplatform deployment.",
