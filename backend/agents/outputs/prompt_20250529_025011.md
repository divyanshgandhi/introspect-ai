From what you know about me, I want you to apply these insights that I learned from a resource to my life...

Here are the key insights:
*   The decision between a topic-based niche and a mission-based niche is personality-dependent; both approaches offer significant monetization potential.
*   Traditional topic-based niching can restrict multi-passionate creators, leading to boredom and an unproductive pursuit of the 'most profitable' niche.
*   Adopt a mission-based niche to discuss diverse topics that align with your overarching purpose, making content generation easier and fostering a dedicated community.
*   To establish a mission-based niche, identify a common 'enemy' or problem to rally against and create an aspirational identity for your audience to adopt.
*   Build a comprehensive 'world' of content by consistently creating a body of work that allows your audience to binge and connect deeply with your brand.
*   Prioritize 'why' (80%) over 'how' (20%) in your content to persuade and connect with a broader, more diverse audience on social media.
*   Cultivate conviction in your ideas and be willing to be wrong; this approach leads to greater learning and impact than over-nuancing your message.

Given my interests in building agentic AI systems and sharing my knowledge around AI on X, my goal to grow my personal brand as a thought leader, and my background of build-in-public posts, sharing about my working experience, and interacting with market trends, these insights are particularly relevant to how I approach my content strategy on X. The concept of a mission-based niche especially appeals to me as I cover both technical builds and broader market trends.

Based on these insights and my specific context, please provide a detailed, actionable plan.
Specifically, I need help with the following:
1.  **Defining My Mission-Based Niche:** Help me identify a clear "enemy" or problem within the AI space that I can rally against, and articulate an aspirational identity for my audience that aligns with my goal of becoming a thought leader in AI.
2.  **Building a Content "World" on X:** Suggest specific content themes, series ideas, or recurring segments for X that allow me to discuss diverse AI topics (agentic systems, market trends, ethical implications, future visions) while consistently reinforcing my core mission and building a comprehensive body of work. How can I ensure this content encourages "binging" and deep connection?
3.  **Content Prioritization ("Why" over "How"):** Provide practical examples or frameworks for how I can prioritize the "why" in my AI content, ensuring I persuade and connect on a deeper level, rather than just instructing on "how" to build or use AI.
4.  **Actionable Steps & Timeline:** Outline a clear, actionable plan for the next 30, 60, and 90 days to implement these strategies on X.
5.  **Metrics for Success:** Suggest specific metrics I should track on X to measure my progress in growing my personal brand, establishing myself as a thought leader, and fostering a dedicated community around my AI mission.
