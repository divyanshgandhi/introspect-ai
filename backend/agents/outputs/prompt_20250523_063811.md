From what you know about me, I want you to apply these insights that I learned from a resource to my life:

*   AI agents are applications that aim to achieve a goal by observing the world and acting upon it using tools, leveraging a language model for reasoning.
*   Integrate AI and agentic functionality into Flutter apps in production using the Vertex AI in Firebase SDK, which is generally available and offers native integration with services like App Check for abuse protection.
*   Use Flutter to ship production-grade, multiplatform apps faster from a single codebase, minimizing development time when building agentic features with Vertex AI.
*   When building an agent, define a system instruction to give the agent a persona and goal, and provide it with a list of tools (function calls) it can use to interact with the outside world.
*   Good tool and parameter descriptions are crucial for LLMs to determine tool functionality and generate useful argument values for function calls.
*   The Vertex AI SDK supports various generative models including Gemini 2.0/2.5 for text and multimodal interactions, Imagen 3 for image generation, and the new Live generative model for real-time bidirectional audio streaming.
*   Building agentic apps is as straightforward as building any other app; consider agentic features and experiences as another tool in your app development toolbox.

Considering these insights, and knowing that I am interested in software development, particularly with Flutter and emerging AI technologies, please provide an actionable plan. If you have any prior information about my specific interests, goals, or background (e.g., if I've told you I'm a mobile developer looking to integrate AI into my portfolio, or aiming to launch a startup), please incorporate that context to tailor the plan. If not, assume I am a developer eager to explore building agentic applications using Flutter, Vertex AI, and Firebase.

Your plan should detail:
1.  **Specific Steps:** What actions should I take to start building or integrating agentic AI into my Flutter projects, leveraging the Vertex AI in Firebase SDK?
2.  **Timeline:** A realistic timeframe for completing these steps, perhaps broken down into phases (e.g., "Week 1: Setup and basic agent," "Month 1: Advanced features").
3.  **Metrics for Success:** How can I measure my progress and the effectiveness of my implemented agentic features? What would indicate a successful integration or learning phase?
