From what you know about me, I want you to apply these insights that I learned from a resource to my life...

Here are the key insights from "Unf*ck Your Life - 7 Productivity Rules of The Top 1%":
*   Learn to say no more often - The ultra wealthy are professionals at saying no to make space for the few important yeses.
*   Guard the first hour of your day - How you start your day sets the tone for everything that follows. No phone, no people, no dopamine drips.
*   Design your defaults - Remove guesswork through standardization. Default meals, wake times, and routines eliminate cognitive load.
*   Optimize your energy cycles, not your schedule - Identify your natural energy patterns and eliminate energy vampires (people, habits, foods).
*   Stack identity, not just habits - Adopt the identity of a high performer. When your identity changes, actions automatically follow.
*   Treat your calendar like a crime scene - Track where your time actually goes to expose the truth about your productivity leakages.
*   Weaponize boredom - Allow yourself periods of boredom and silence for creativity and intuition. Boredom is your brain detoxing.

As a software developer with Python experience, my primary interests are AI, machine learning, and productivity, and my key goals are building better applications and improving my coding skills. Given this, please create a personalized, actionable plan for me to integrate these 7 productivity rules into my daily and weekly routines.

For each rule, suggest specific, practical steps tailored to my work as a software developer and my goals related to AI/ML and application development.

The plan should include:
*   **Specific Steps:** Detailed actions for implementing each rule in a development context (e.g., how to "say no" to non-essential coding tasks, how to "guard the first hour" for deep work on AI models, "designing defaults" for coding environments or learning sprints, "optimizing energy cycles" for peak coding performance, "stacking identity" as an expert AI/ML developer, "treating calendar like a crime scene" for analyzing time spent on coding vs. distractions, and "weaponizing boredom" for ideating new application features or debugging strategies).
*   **Timeline:** A suggested phased approach (e.g., what to focus on in the next 7 days, next 30 days, or ongoing daily/weekly habits).
*   **Metrics:** Measurable ways to track my progress and success for each rule (e.g., reduction in context switches, amount of focused coding time, number of new features built, successful completion of a learning module).
