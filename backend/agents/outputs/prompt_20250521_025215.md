From what you know about me, I want you to apply these insights that I learned from a resource to my life...

'Prioritize your passions by allocating more time and energy to the most important ones. Implement time blocking, a proven time management strategy, to dedicate specific, focused blocks of time to each priority. Utilize SMART goals to break down plans, track progress precisely, and prevent burnout. Regularly check in with yourself to assess how well you're managing priorities and adjust schedules and goals accordingly. Embrace flexibility and don't feel guilty about temporarily putting some passions on the back burner.'

As a software engineer strong in Python, my main goal is to launch an AI MVP in 90 days while managing my day-job. I'm also deeply interested in productivity hacks and personal knowledge management (PKM) for improving learning retention, but I need to ensure these interests support, rather than detract from, my core MVP goal, especially with a limited budget for side projects.

Given this context, please provide a detailed, actionable plan. Focus on how I can effectively prioritize and manage my time to hit the 90-day AI MVP launch goal, while strategically incorporating my interests in productivity and PKM to support this primary objective without causing burnout.

Your plan should include:
- Specific steps for prioritizing and time blocking for a software engineer balancing a day-job with a side project.
- A proposed timeline or milestones for the 90-day MVP launch.
- Measurable metrics to track progress for both the MVP development and improvements in learning retention/PKM.
- Strategies for flexible integration of PKM and productivity hacks to directly aid the MVP development and learning.
