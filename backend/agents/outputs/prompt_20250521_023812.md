From what you know about me, I want you to apply these insights that I learned from a resource to my life:

"To manage multiple passions effectively, prioritize, use time blocking for focus, set SMART goals for progress, establish flexible routines, find synergies between interests, and embrace your identity as a multi-potentialite. This is an evolving journey requiring regular adjustments."

As a software engineer with a strong background in Python, interested in AI app-building, productivity hacks, and personal knowledge management, my main goal is to launch an AI MVP in 90 days while working my day job and improving my learning retention, all on a limited budget.

Using the insights about prioritizing, time blocking, SMART goals, routines, synergies, and continuous adjustment, please provide a specific, actionable plan for me to manage my time and focus over the next 90 days to achieve my MVP launch goal and improve my learning retention. Include concrete steps, a suggested timeline for the 90 days, and metrics I can use to track my progress towards both goals. How can I best leverage my existing skills and interests to create synergy and overcome the budget constraint?
