From what you know about me, I want you to apply these insights that I learned from a resource to my life...
"The content I intended to learn from was inaccessible because the captions could not be retrieved, preventing summary or extraction of key insights."

This inability to access and extract knowledge efficiently is a direct challenge to my goals. As a software engineer focused on AI app-building and productivity hacks, I need reliable methods for acquiring information quickly and improving my learning retention, especially while working towards launching an AI MVP in 90 days with a day job and limited budget. My background is strong in Python, and I'm constantly working on side projects that require leveraging new information effectively.

Given this context, please provide an actionable plan detailing strategies and tools (considering my Python skills and limited budget) to overcome information access barriers and improve my overall process for learning retention and knowledge application for my projects. Include specific steps I can implement immediately, a timeline for integrating these strategies, and metrics to track their impact on my productivity and progress towards the MVP launch.
