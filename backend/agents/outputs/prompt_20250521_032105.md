From what you know about me, I want you to apply these insights that I learned from a resource to my life. I am a software engineer with 3 years of experience, and my primary interest is AI and machine learning, with a specific goal of building a personal assistant app.

Here are the key insights:

*   **Point:** Prioritize passions by allocating more time and energy to the most important ones to accelerate progress.
*   **Point:** Utilize time blocking to dedicate specific time slots for each priority, enhancing focus and productivity.
*   **Point:** Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to create a clear plan, measure progress, and reduce stress.
*   **Point:** Be aware of burnout signs (overwhelm, apathy, fatigue) and be willing to readjust your plan, break down tasks, or take longer breaks.
*   **Point:** Embrace the "multipotentialite" mindset, celebrating diverse interests rather than feeling pressured to pick one calling.
*   **Point:** Look for synergies between interests to merge passions into multifaceted projects that feed multiple areas at once.
*   **Point:** Regularly check in on your progress to rebalance priorities, identify new interests, and adjust your schedule and goals.

Given my background and goal of building a personal assistant app leveraging AI and machine learning, please provide an actionable plan. This plan should specifically incorporate these insights to help me effectively pursue my interest in AI/ML, manage the development of my personal assistant app, and potentially integrate my broader software engineering experience.

Your plan should include:
1.  Specific steps for applying each relevant insight to my app development and AI/ML learning journey.
2.  A suggested timeline for key milestones in the app's development, considering my full-time work.
3.  Measurable metrics to track progress and identify potential burnout.
